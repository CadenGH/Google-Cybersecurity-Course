# Google-Cybersecurity-Course
<h1>I started my Google Cybersecurity course on 05/26. - I'll only be working on this part-time, (maybe 5-10 hours a week) as I am still finishing up my Cybersecurity Bootcamp. I will try my best to share some details about each module so anyone curious about the course can get a feel for it and see if it's something they might find useful.</h1>

<h2>Activity 4: Linux CLI Labs</h2>

- [Linux Lab 1] - - 
This lab consists of all basics commands to teach beginners how to navigate through directories and files. The standard ls, cd, ../, cat, etc. 
It also covers the next step up, which talks about creating and removing files with touch and rm, and then onto creating and removing directories with mkdir and rmdir. 
After doing those tasks you're then taught how to move and edit files using mv and nano. That sums up all of the first Linux CLI lab. 

- [Linux Lab 2] - - 
This lab teaches users how to add and manage users using the Linux CLI. Goes over relative commands such as useradd, usermod, userdel, chown, etc.
Starts by teaching how to add and delete a user using useradd and userdel. Assigning file ownership using chown (chown=change ownership). As well as adding a user to a group, using usermod.

<h2>Activity 5: SQL Labs</h2>

This lab will get you a pretty good understanding of "basic" SQL commands to read tables and filter them by X with keywords such as SELECT, FROM, ORDER BY, WHERE, LIKE % etc. 

- [SQL Lab 2] - - 
Lab 2 goes more indepth with what you can really do with all of the previous keywords, as well as teaching some new ones like AND, BETWEEN, OR, NOT, etc.
